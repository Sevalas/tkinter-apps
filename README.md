# tkinter-apps

Hello! This repository contains some tkinter projects with which I have learned how to create windows applications in python.

You can find executables compiled with pyinstaller in the ["executables"](./executables) folder, you can also find the code ready to be modified and compiled by yourself in the folder ["code"](./code).

The applications you will find are: 
* Calculator with "iOS'' style:

* Client register manager:

  ![crm_img](./static/crm.png)

* TaskManager:

  ![taskmanager_img](./static/task_manager.png)

* Image Carrousel:
